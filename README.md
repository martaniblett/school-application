## Project Goals
General:
To create a web application with CRUD functionality using  Virtual Machine (VM) and SQL Instance and applying Python, HTML, Flask, Jinja2, Gunicorn.

Specific:
Motivation: many supplementary education organisations, such as the Polish Saturday School, need a simple information management system to ensure that staff, student and other records are up-to-date, easily accessible and secure.      



The final version of the School Application is envisaged as a fully functional web-based school management information system. This project is a 'sprint 1' that delivers first version of the app that allows to create and manipulate staff information and assignes staff to classes.

#### Sprint 1 and the Big Picture
The fully functional application will enable to create, manipulate and link different types of data and information about people, educational resources, timetables etc. The ERD document demostrates first stages of the project development, with Sprint 1 actually delivered. The initial plan was to develop a solution that shows a daily staff rota (sprint 2) to improve information for staff who would be able to easily check if there are any changes to their usual class assignment.

## Testing
Due to time constraints only very basic unit testing was developed, this area needs more attention at tne later stages of app development.

 ## Future Version Improvements
 
 - Automate processes (eg. Jenkins, Selenium)
 - Improve graphic design 
 - Implement more complex architecture
 - Develop unit and integration tests

## Key Learnings(#learn)

Working on this project has highlighted the importance of: 
1. Incremental software development to detect problems at the earliest stage 
2. Planning the desired functionality into app design
3. Keeping initial database schema simple and gradually building the complexity

And, finally - it's amazing how much can be learned in 5 short weeks! Ben and Luke - THANK YOU!
